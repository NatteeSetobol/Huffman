# Huffman
This implementation of Huffman's compression algorithm is built using modern C++ programming principles, leveraging the power of object-oriented design and template-based programming to deliver an efficient and reliable compression solution. The binary tree data structure, coupled with advanced self-rotating and balancing techniques, ensures that the compressed files are optimized for storage and transmission, while minimizing the loss of data quality.

g++ and the STL is required to in order to compile this in either Linux or OSX.
