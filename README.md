# Huffman
Huffman's compression algorthmn in C++ using g++ in Linux.

This was originally made for a company I use to work for. I did a lot of reasearch, finding out how this algorthmn works before coding this. 
This was actually the first time I used trees in C++ and I also the first time I have done a Breadth first search, as well as self rotation balance trees.


g++ and the STL is required to in order to compile this in either Linux or OSX.
