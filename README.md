# Huffman
This implementation of Huffman's compression algorithm is built using C++ programming principles, leveraging the power of object-oriented design to deliver an efficient and reliable compression solution. The binary tree data structure, coupled with self-rotating and balancing techniques, ensures the compressed files are optimized for storage.

g++ and the STL is required to in order to compile this in either Linux or OSX.
